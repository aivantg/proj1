#Part 1

What is this whole references column type jazz.

I initially made my column in the database an integer and ran db:migrate but later when I read the Note I wanted to change it to the references type. so I changed the migration file and ran db:reset in order to run the migrations from scratch. What's best practice? are we never supposed to touch migration files ourselves?

#Part 2

Can you explain the relationships between variables in an .erb file and the controller?
