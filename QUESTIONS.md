#Part 1

What is this whole references column type jazz.

I initially made my column in the database an integer and ran db:migrate but later when I read the Note I wanted to change it to the references type. so I changed the migration file and ran db:reset in order to run the migrations from scratch. What's best practice? are we never supposed to touch migration files ourselves?

#Part 2

Can you explain the relationships between variables in an .erb file and the controller?
Do people often use erb in the real world to serve actual web pages? or do they use other things?

Also, what is the extent of form builder's powers?

How the hell does accessing and updating model parameters work. Do you always have to use Pokemon.update and such?

#Part 4

What are the relations between objects and their id's? Feels somewhat interchangeable (probably because I don't know enough about them)

#Part 5

Is using flash perfectly good practice?
Can you update the page without having a redirect?
